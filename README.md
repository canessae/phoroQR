# phoroQR
There is an increasing interest in developing techniques to identify and assess data to allow easy and continuous access to resources, to services or security places. In order to give access to these resources usually different kind of credentials are used. Moreover to maintain safe the credentials some approaches as dual factor authentication have been introduced. In this article a new system, named photoQR, to avoid forgeries of credentials is proposed, which is based on a card containing two objects: one picture and one QR code containing data related to the picture. The idea is that the picture and the QR can assess each other embedding proper data in the QR. The QR without the picture cannot be assessed and vice versa. An open source prototype of the proposed system has been implemented in Python and can be used both in offline and real-time environment, which effectively combines security concepts and image processing algorithms to obtain data assessment.
